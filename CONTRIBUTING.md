## Translation Rules

Translations must follow Slovenian translation rules from
[Lugos](https://wiki.lugos.si/slovenjenje:pravila).


## Development Practices

Developing the language module and the main Magento store separately requires
a different workflow. After cloning the repository locally, you can just do the
following in package folder:

```bash
# Make sure you have Magento repositories defined in your Composer configuration
composer config repositories.magento composer https://repo.magento.com --global
# Install dependencies for development
composer install
```


## Release Process

*(For repository maintainers)*

This repository follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). When source
code changes or new features are implemented, a new version (e.g. 1.x.y) is
released by the following release process:

* **1. Run the build**

  Run the build script to get HTML version of README and some other things that
  can be automated:

  ```bash
  $ ./bin/build
  ```

* **2. Update Changelog:**

  Create an entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) describing all the changes
  from previous release.

* **3. Tag a new release:**

  Tag a new version on GitHub, and attach ZIP sl_si-1.x.y.zip as a binary file
  for manual installation.
